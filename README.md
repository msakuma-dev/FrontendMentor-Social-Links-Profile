## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM Methodology
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm pretty happy to get more understanding how CSS works. Specially how some properties don't pass to the child, like flex.

### Continued development

Still working on how to layout things properly and basic understanding of CSS.
